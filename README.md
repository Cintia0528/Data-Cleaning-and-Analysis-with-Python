# Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-with-Python
## Task
To evaluate whether agressive discounting is beneficial in the long-run.

## Overview 
Eniac's board noticed that the last quarter's increasing sales volume did not translate to higher revenue.
  _Marketing_: Believes that discounts are beneficial in the long-run for customer acquisition and retention.
  _Board_: Is concerned that their positioning as a premium quality provider is compromised by agressive discounts.

## Context
Eniac is an **online marketplace** specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. The board wants an **immediate answer** to whether the company should continue **discounting** or not. **The data is compromised**, therefore before analysis we must **clean** the data and **assess its quality**, in addition to defining how it **impairs our decision-making ability**.

### Challenge: 
*How to clean and assure the data's quality without losing too much informatoin, so as to retain enough data for decision making?* 

## Approach
Evaluate the database:
1. Clean data for unreadable entries, duplicates and other obvious errors
2. Assess the remaining data for quality
3. Note the constraints the loss of data caused in our ability to make decisions
4. Compare the recommended prices, and product catalog to the actual sales

## Deliverables
5 minute PowerPoint presentation found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pi3bMzv7sUl4BDP809HX1JG2WO2Z51bK/view?usp=sharing) to the Board of Directors, that summarizes the findings and suggests a course of action.
Colab code is found [here](https://github.com/Cintia0528/Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-with-Python.git).
